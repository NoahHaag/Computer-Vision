# Computer-Vision

My attempt at segmenting field images of fish. 
Training is done on images from DeepFish.

If you find this and have any optimizations or suggestions please feel free to let me know or add your ideas. 
Segement_2023 is my latest attempt at this project. I might add updates here>
- right now I am trying to split the images into train, test and validation folders before moving onto an imaging model.
